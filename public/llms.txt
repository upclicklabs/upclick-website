## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is AEO?
AEO stands for Answer Engine Optimization. It is the practice of optimizing content so AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude can find, understand, and cite your brand in their responses.

### How is AEO different from SEO?
SEO focuses on ranking in traditional search results where users click through to websites. AEO focuses on getting your brand mentioned directly in AI responses, where users may never visit your site but still learn about your brand.

### Why is AEO important?
95% of B2B buyers now use AI tools during their research and buying process. If your brand is not optimized for AI search engines, you are missing out on a massive and growing audience.

### What are the four pillars of AEO?
The four pillars are Content (structured Q&A, freshness), Technical (schema markup, AI crawler access), Authority (brand mentions, expert credentials), and Measurement (AI visibility tracking, ROI).

### How long does AEO take to show results?
Some businesses see improvements in AI visibility within weeks, while building strong authority signals typically takes several months of consistent effort.

### Can small businesses benefit from AEO?
Yes, small businesses can compete with larger competitors by creating well-structured content that answers questions in their niche, implementing schema markup, and building authority.
